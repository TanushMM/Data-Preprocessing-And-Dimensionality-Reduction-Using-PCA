# Vehicle Dataset Analysis with PCA and Linear Regression

## Description 

This project analyzes a vehicle dataset containing features like bore size, engine capacity, compression ratio, horsepower, and curb weight. It demonstrates a comprehensive data preprocessing workflow followed by dimensionality reduction using __Principal Component Analysis (PCA)__ and __linear regression modeling__.

## Expected Results

- The project generates data visualizations that provide insights into the distribution of features in the vehicle dataset.
- It trains and evaluates two linear regression models: one using all features and another using features identified as important by PCA.
- The analysis compares the performance of these models, highlighting the potential benefits of dimensionality reduction for this dataset.

## Disclaimer 

This project serves as a demonstration of data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and linear regression. The specific effectiveness of PCA and model performance might vary depending on the chosen dataset and chosen models.

## Further Development

- Explore alternative dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or ICA.
- Implement more advanced machine learning models for prediction tasks.
- Tune hyperparameters for both linear regression models to potentially improve performance.
